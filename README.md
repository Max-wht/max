# This is my first Java project

The project is based on `aliyun IOT`, which can collect information and message. The project can be used in industrial production field, where workers should inspect the equipment regularly. The time and place when worker completes the inspection will be record in MySQL. The Java project will deal with the data and send message to browser. Besides, the web can manage and assign worker's work. 

Now it is not completely OK. Maybe 2025/3 the project will be done.
